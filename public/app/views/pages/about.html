<p><h1>Introduction</h1></p>
<p>The UK National Landslide Database indicates that rockfall and landside incidents have significantly increased from 2 incidents in 1974 to 60 in 20141. As a result, infrastructure such as railways incur lengthy service disruptions, local- to national-scale financial implications and not to forget human loses that can occur. In 2011, a rockfall incident in Stromeferry (Scotland) cost £3.2M to repair and trains were suspended for four months, which had a massive impact on tourism and local businesses. Similarly, several rockfall incidents on railways across Europe have led to fatal train / rock collisions such as in France2, Switzerland3, and Italy4.
To mitigate risks posed by rockfalls, many areas are installing rockfall catch fences. These fences are protective mechanical structures that prevent railways / infrastructure from being damaged by falling rocks. The fence stops and retains falling rocks by dissipating their kinetic energy through permanent deformation. A deficient catch fence allows falling rocks to reach train lines that causes damages of the infrastructure and/or collision with trains, which is why a robust solution is necessary in areas at high risk of rock falls. In addition to the fences, continuous monitoring of catch fences is necessary to ensure that they can provide the required protection.
</p>
<p><h1>Innovative solution</h1></p>
<p>
The Rockfall Monitoring System (RMS) is an innovative approach to continuously monitor rockfall and landslide incidents in real-time on catch fences. RMS combines vibration detection sensors, cameras that attach to the catch fences, and web-based detection algorithms to notify operators via mobile phone networks of impacts / collisions on the fences.
On detecting a vibration caused by an impact, the sensors send a real-time notification via Gateways to the website, where advanced detection algorithms automatically analyse the data and send recommendations to railway safety engineers. On installing the RMS system, a list of pre-defined contacts will be attached to the website so that notifications are sent directly to the correct people. Engineers can request further information, such as photos from cameras attached to the catch fences to confirm the nature and severity of the incident before an action plan is formed. Based on the information provided by the system, actions suitable to the scale of incident can be initiated and planned with appropriate personnel deployed. For serious incidents, this would result in the suspension of services and closure of the line to prevent collision / derailment and trains operating in the area would be notified in a timely manner due to the real-time nature of the system.
The RMS service will enhance overall safety on railways and will help prevent serious incidents, protect passengers’ lives, save significant repair costs, and minimise disruption to rail services.

<p><h1>The novelty of RMS service</h1></p>
<p>
There are two types of hardware in the RMS service:
• Sensors: Detects vibrations in catch fences and sends notifications to Gateways. Powered by on-board batteries with a bespoke power-saving plan that allows the sensors to work in a sleep-mode (minimal power consumption) and only wake up for health checks and incidents. 5-year lifespan.
• Gateway: Forwards notifications to the RMS website using multi-network roaming plans to access the strongest GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) network available. Gateways will be attached to posts at points nearest GSM network where there are areas of no / poor reception. Gateways have cameras that can take photos in daylight and at dark for up to 50 m distance and send them to the web service. Gateways and cameras will use on-board batteries that are backed up by solar panels and have a five-year lifetime.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the combination of effective impact detection hardware and visual inspection, the RMS web service was designed using our own mathematical algorithms defined over four years of working on advanced computational models of catch fences and rigorous full-scale impact tests to determine real impacts from false ones with a high degree of certainty. This enhanced RMS service eliminates false warnings and ensures that only serious impacts are reported to our clients. When a rockfall accident occurs, sensors will detect the impact vibration and send notifications to the nearest Gateway in real-time. The Gateways forward all collected notifications to the web service, where data are analysed using the built-in algorithms. If the accident is classed as serious, the web service requests photos from the cameras in the affected area. The analysed data along with photos will then be sent to pre-defined railway safety engineers for decision-making, such as service suspension on the line or deployment of personnel to the affected areas. For non-serious accidents, QTS monitoring team will be notified of further actions including replacing or fixing deficient catch fences, site photo requests, and arrange site visits if required. All sensors’ health checks and warning notifications will be archived on the website for future revisions. Finally, the hardware design of the RMS sensors allow them to be installed on any catch fence design.

<p>
Looking to the future, the RMS service has far wider application than railways, including road infrastructure protection and protecting residential zones at risk from rock slope stability issues, which is not just a national problem but a global issue.
